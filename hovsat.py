# Read in image and fit to lat lon grid
# Return 2d array for image pixel intensities
# and 2d array of coords

# With the array, select values along a particular transect.
# may require interpolation to a higher resolution grid.
# return a 1d array of intensities and a 1d array of coords

# process multiple images in a sequence and stack 1d arrays
# into a 2d array that has dimensions of space x time
# returns a 2d array

# plot a given 2d array as a hovmoller

# bonus: intelligently interpolate the hovmoller such that
# coherent wave structures are picked out. requires selection of
# appropriate interpolation lines in image to create an
# interpolation field.
